# osusume

a machine-learning based anime and manga recommendation platform. this repository currently only contains the front-end, but I may convince my colleague to put his backend code here as well.

coming soon to a website near you

and by soon, that probably means sometime mid-2020 given mine and [my colleague](https://github.com/NNarma)'s schedules.

Formerly located at [osusume-frontend](https://github.com/ennukee/osusume-frontend) but was moved here due to me deciding to redo the entire site with the knowledge I gained from developing AniUpdater
