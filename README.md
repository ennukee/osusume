# osusume

a machine-learning based anime and manga recommendation platform. this repository currently only contains the front-end, but I may convince my colleague to put his backend code here as well.

coming soon to a website near you

~~and by soon, that probably means sometime mid-2020 given mine and [my colleague](https://github.com/NNarma)'s schedules.~~

jokes on everybody, who knows when this will finish, if it ever will. back here we are again for another refresh in 2023, let's see if it finishes this time.

Formerly located at [osusume-frontend](https://github.com/ennukee/osusume-frontend) but was moved here due to me deciding to redo the entire site with the knowledge I gained from developing AniUpdater
